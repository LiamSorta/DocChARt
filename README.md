# The problem
* Current medical care is:
  * Inefficient (i.e. pagers)
  * Involves the use of multiple sources of medical data
  * Increasingly time-consuming (56% of ward round [WR] spent on paperwork, 18% on delays/interruptions)
* Fernandes & Eneje report WR inefficiencies in note-taking
  * Noted time lost during WR loking for notes, writing medical issues, past medical history
  * Average time ~8-9.5 minutes medical WR
  * Reduced to 6 min with electronic data printed for WR
