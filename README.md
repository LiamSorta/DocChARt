## Hackmed 2017 demonstration: 
# DocChARt

## Andrew, Diego, Jannah, Liam & Wai Ching


## The problem
* Current medical care is:
  * Inefficient (i.e. pagers)
  * Involves the use of multiple sources of medical data
  * Increasingly time-consuming (56% of ward round [WR] spent on paperwork, 18% on delays/interruptions)
* Fernandes & Eneje report WR inefficiencies in note-taking
  * Noted time lost during WR loking for notes, writing medical issues, past medical history
  * Average time ~8-9.5 minutes medical WR
  * Reduced to 6 min with electronic data printed for WR
  
## The solution DocChARt
* Innovative solution to efficiency of care
* Use of portable augmented reality (AR) technology for:
  * Quick, secure viewing of unique relevant patient medical data linked to ID
  * Dynamic vital sign presentation
    * Linked with bedside clinical devices
    * Linked with medical alert systems
  * Viewing relevant medical history in real-time 
    * Linked with electronic medical records, or manually inputted data
* While easily accessible via smartphone, tablet or customised headset
