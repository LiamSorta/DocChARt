# Description


## The problem
* Current medical care is:
  * Inefficient (i.e. pagers)
  * Involves the use of multiple sources of medical data
  * Increasingly time-consuming (56% of ward round [WR] spent on paperwork, 18% on delays/interruptions)
* Fernandes & Eneje report WR inefficiencies in note-taking
  * Noted time lost during WR loking for notes, writing medical issues, past medical history
  * Average time ~8-9.5 minutes medical WR per patient
  * Reduced to 6 min with electronic data printed for WR
  
## The solution: DocChARt
* Innovative solution to efficiency of care
* Use of portable augmented reality (AR) technology for:
  * Quick, secure viewing of unique relevant patient medical data linked to ID
  * Dynamic vital sign presentation
    * Linked with bedside clinical devices
    * Linked with medical alert systems
  * Viewing relevant medical history in real-time 
    * Linked with electronic medical records, or manually inputted data
* While easily accessible via smartphone, tablet or customised headset

## Information included
1) Patient identifier, demographics
2) Observations/vital signs
   * Option to zoom to specific vitals, view trends
3) Menu to zoom to relevant history, allergies, medications, bloods

* Secure, two factor verification for login by physician/treating clinician
* Ability to access data via unique patient code
   * Portability of information
   
 ## What makes this different?
* Ability
   * Providing dynamic information quickly in real time
* Efficiency 
   * Potential to improve speed, reduce WR time, improve patient care, reduce length of stay
* Portability
   * Can use existing technology â€“ patient labels for use
   * Use of AR app on smartphone/tablet
   * Headset battery standby of ~6 hours before recharge
* Security
   * Carried by clinicians
   * Secured by two factor authentication, intranet system linkage 

## Conclusion
* DocChARt: innovative new approach to improving clinical efficiency
* Accessible real-time clinical information using adapted software + hardware
* Secure, reliable, and verifiable
* Not a replacement for medical care, but a valuable assistant
